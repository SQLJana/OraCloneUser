"# OraCloneUser" 
The script clones a user. To do so, it prompts for the user to clone and the new user plus a few other details which take Y or N as input.

Save the script to a folder. E.g., cloneuser.sql
cd to the folder you saved the script
Open SQL*Plus and login using your credentials
Run the script
@cloneuser.sql

Input appropriate values for the prompts.
